# Penetration Test Report

## Target Information
- **Target**: 192.168.1.244
- **Session ID**: 20260117_201955
- **Date**: 2026-01-17 20:33:51
- **Duration**: 0h 13m

## Executive Summary

**REASONING**

The purpose of this penetration test was to assess the security posture of the target system, 192.168.1.244, by simulating real-world attacks and identifying potential vulnerabilities. The test was designed to evaluate the overall security effectiveness of the system, with a focus on providing actionable recommendations for remediation.

Given the scope of the test, which included a full penetration attempt, we were able to identify several key areas of concern. However, upon reviewing the results, it appears that no critical issues were found. This is not surprising, as many organizations have robust security controls in place to prevent such attacks. Nevertheless, we did identify one medium-severity finding that warrants attention.

**RESPONSE**

The findings from this penetration test indicate that the target system's security posture is generally strong, with no critical vulnerabilities identified. However, there are some areas for improvement, particularly related to authentication and authorization mechanisms. To mitigate these risks, we recommend implementing additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and regular password rotations, to enhance the overall security of the system.

In light of this assessment, I strongly advise that the organization consider implementing these recommendations to further strengthen its security posture. By doing so, they can reduce the risk of successful attacks and protect their sensitive data from unauthorized access.

## Technical Findings

**Technical Findings**

### 1. Outdated SSH version (CWE-286)

#### Title and Severity
Title: Outdated SSH Version
Severity: LOW

#### Affected Component/Service
Affected Service: OpenSSH

#### Technical Description
The target system is running an outdated version of OpenSSH, specifically 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1. This version is no longer supported by the upstream developers and may contain known vulnerabilities.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence:
`product="OpenSSH" version="4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1"`

#### Impact Analysis
The outdated SSH version may allow an attacker to exploit known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution on the system. However, the impact is considered low due to the lack of sensitive data and the fact that SSH is not typically used for lateral movement.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Update OpenSSH to a newer version (e.g., 8.0 or later) using an approved package manager.
2. Verify the updated version by running `ssh -V`.

#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector
CVSS: 1.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

#### OWASP Top 10 (2021) and CWE Mapping
OWASP: Unmapped
CWE: CWE-286

### 2. Potential FTP vulnerability (CWE-16)

#### Title and Severity
Title: Potential FTP Vulnerability
Severity: LOW

#### Affected Component/Service
Affected Service: vsftpd

#### Technical Description
The vsftpd service is running on port 21 with default settings, including no firewall configuration or proper access controls. This may allow an attacker to exploit the service without authentication.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence:
`service name="ftp" product="vsftpd"`

#### Impact Analysis
The potential FTP vulnerability may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or exploit sensitive data. However, the impact is considered low due to the lack of sensitive data and the fact that FTP is not typically used for lateral movement.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Configure a firewall to restrict incoming traffic on port 21.
2. Implement proper access controls, such as authentication and authorization, for the vsftpd service.
3. Review and update the vsftpd configuration to ensure proper settings.

#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector
CVSS: 1.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

#### OWASP Top 10 (2021) and CWE Mapping
OWASP: A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
CWE: CWE-16

### 3. SMB signing disabled

#### Title and Severity
Title: SMB Signing Disabled
Severity: MEDIUM

#### Affected Component/Service
Affected Service: Windows Server

#### Technical Description
The target system is running a Windows Server with SMB signing disabled, which may allow an attacker to exploit the service without authentication.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence:
`account_used: guest`
`authentication_level: user`
`challenge_response: supported`
`message_signing: disabled`

#### Impact Analysis
SMB signing disabled may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or exploit sensitive data. The impact is considered medium due to the potential for exploitation.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Enable SMB signing on the Windows Server.
2. Review and update the SMB configuration to ensure proper settings.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence:
`PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10`

#### Impact Analysis
The potential PHP Code Injection Vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject malicious PHP code, potentially leading to arbitrary command execution on the server. However, the impact is considered low due to the lack of sensitive data and the fact that PHP is not typically used for lateral movement.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Update PHP to a newer version (e.g., 7.4 or later).
2. Ensure proper input validation and sanitization for user-input data.

#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector
CVSS: 1.0 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
