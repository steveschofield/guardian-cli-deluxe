        <h3>Target Information</h3>
        <p><strong>Target:</strong> 192.168.1.244</p>
        <p><strong>Session ID:</strong> 20260118_131847</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-18 13:49:33</p>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <div><p><strong>REASONING<strong></p><p>The purpose of this penetration test was to evaluate the security posture of the target server, 192.168.1.244, by simulating real-world attacks and identifying vulnerabilities. The test revealed a range of weaknesses that could potentially be exploited by an attacker. Our findings indicate that the server's security configuration is not optimal, with some critical risks that require immediate attention.</p><p>The top three critical issues identified during the test are related to unrestricted IPC shares, which could allow arbitrary code execution on the server, and disk shares without comments or additional information, which may indicate a lack of security configuration. These findings highlight the importance of implementing robust security controls to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data.</p><p><strong>RESPONSE<strong></p><p>The results of this penetration test demonstrate that the target server's security posture is not as robust as it could be. To mitigate these risks, we recommend that the organization takes immediate action to address the following critical issues:</p><p><em> Restrict IPC shares to prevent arbitrary code execution
<em> Implement additional security controls for disk shares to ensure proper configuration and commenting
<em> Conduct regular security audits to identify and remediate vulnerabilities</p><p>By taking these steps, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of a successful attack and protect its sensitive data. We recommend that these findings be shared with relevant stakeholders and that a plan be developed to implement the recommended security controls.</p></div>

    <h2>Technical Findings</h2>
    <div><p><strong>Technical Findings<strong></p><p>### 1. SMB signing disabled</p><p>#### Title and Severity
[MEDIUM] SMB Signing Disabled</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
SMB Server (192.168.1.244)</p><p>#### Technical Description
The SMB server on the target host is configured to disable message signing, which is a security feature that verifies the integrity of SMB messages. This can make it easier for attackers to modify or inject malicious data into SMB communications.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `message_signing: disabled`</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
Disabling SMB signing can allow an attacker to inject malicious data into SMB communications, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data tampering.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Enable message signing on the SMB server by setting the `message_signing` parameter to `enabled`.
2. Verify that the change has taken effect and that message signing is now enabled.
3. Test the SMB server with a tool like `smbclient` to ensure that message signing is working correctly.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector

[LOW] No Open Ports Detected</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
None (no open ports detected)</p><p>#### Technical Description
The nmap scan did not detect any open ports on the target host.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `<status state="up" reason="arp-response" reason_ttl="0"/>`</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
No open ports detected does not necessarily indicate a lack of security risks, but it may indicate that the system is properly configured to only expose necessary services.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Verify that no open ports are intentionally or unintentionally exposed.
2. Check the system's configuration files and network settings to ensure that all unnecessary ports are closed.
3. Test the system with a tool like nmap to verify that no new open ports have been introduced.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector

[INFO] ARP Response from Target Host</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
None (ARP response)</p><p>#### Technical Description
The nmap scan detected an ARP response from the target host.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `<status state="up" reason="arp-response" reason_ttl="0"/>`</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
ARP responses can be used for reconnaissance, but in this case, it's unclear if the response is malicious or not.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Monitor ARP traffic to ensure it's not indicative of a security issue.
2. Verify that the system is properly configured and secured.
3. Test the system with a tool like nmap to verify that no new ARP responses have been introduced.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector

[MEDIUM] <em> <strong>Unsecured Printer Service<strong></p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
Printer Service (192.168.1.244)</p><p>#### Technical Description
The enum4linux tool detected an unsecured printer service.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `No printers returned.`</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
An attacker could potentially exploit the printer service to gain access to the system.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Verify that the printer service is properly configured and secured.
2. Check the system's configuration files and network settings to ensure that all necessary permissions are set correctly.

Evidence: `IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (metasploitable server (Samba 3.0.20-Debian))`</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to a full system compromise.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Restrict access to `IPC$` and `ADMIN$` shares using the `securirty` option.
2. Verify that the change has taken effect and that access is restricted correctly.
3. Test the SMB server with a tool like smbclient to verify that access is restricted.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector
