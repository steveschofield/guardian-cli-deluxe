## Target Information
- **Target**: 192.168.1.244
- **Session ID**: 20260118_131847
- **Date**: 2026-01-18 13:46:29
- **Duration**: 0h 27m

## Executive Summary

**REASONING**

The purpose of this penetration test was to assess the security posture of a critical business asset, specifically the server at 192.168.1.244. The test aimed to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors, and provide recommendations for remediation. Based on the findings, it is clear that the server's security configuration poses a significant risk to the organization's data and systems.

The top three critical issues identified during the test are of utmost concern. Unrestricted IPC shares may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches. Similarly, disk shares with no comments or additional information may indicate a lack of security configuration, making it easier for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the need for enhanced security measures to protect against such threats.

**RESPONSE**

In light of these critical risks, we strongly recommend that the organization takes immediate action to address these vulnerabilities. Specifically, we suggest implementing strict access controls on IPC shares and ensuring that all disk shares have comments and additional information to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, we recommend conducting regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and remediate potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. By taking these steps, the organization can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and protect its critical assets.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The server at 192.168.1.244 has a moderate to high security posture, with several vulnerabilities identified during the penetration test. The top three critical issues highlighted in this report are unrestricted IPC shares and disk shares with no comments or additional information. We strongly recommend that the organization takes immediate action to address these vulnerabilities, including implementing strict access controls and conducting regular security audits. By doing so, we can minimize the risk of data breaches and protect our critical assets.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (CONCISE VERSION)**

## Technical Findings

**Technical Findings Section**

### 1. [MEDIUM] SMB signing disabled

#### Title and Severity
Title: Unsecured SMB Signing
Severity: MEDIUM (5.5/10)

#### Affected Component/Service
SMB Server

#### Technical Description
The SMB server is configured to disable message signing, which can lead to tampering with files and data.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `message_signing: disabled`

#### Impact Analysis
Disabling SMB signing can allow an attacker to modify or delete files on the system. This can lead to data loss or unauthorized access.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Enable SMB signing by setting the `message_signing` parameter to `require`.
2. Review and update any scripts or tools that rely on SMB signing.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures, such as encryption.

#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector (if applicable)
CVSS: 5.5 (est.) / AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

#### OWASP Top 10 (2021) and CWE Mapping

### 2. [LOW] No open ports detected

#### Title and Severity
Title: No Open Ports Detected
Severity: LOW (1.0/10)

#### Affected Component/Service
N/A

#### Technical Description
The system does not have any open ports detected.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `<status state="up" reason="arp-response" reason_ttl="0"/>`

#### Impact Analysis
No potential exploitation vectors exist, but it is essential to verify the host's configuration to ensure no open ports are intentionally or unintentionally exposed.

#### Remediation Steps
1. Verify the host's configuration to ensure no open ports are intentionally or unintentionally exposed.
2. Review network configurations and firewall rules.

#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector (if applicable)

### 3. [INFO] ARP response from the target host

#### Title and Severity
Title: ARP Response from Target Host
Severity: INFO (1.0/10)

#### Affected Component/Service
N/A

#### Technical Description
An ARP response was detected, but its impact is unclear.

#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: `<status state="up" reason="arp-response" reason_ttl="0"/>`

#### Impact Analysis
ARP responses can be used for reconnaissance, but in this case, it's unclear if the response is malicious or not. Monitoring ARP traffic to ensure it's not indicative of a security issue is recommended.

#### Remediation Steps

## Remediation Plan

**REASONING**

To create an actionable remediation plan, I considered the severity of each finding, potential impact on the system, and ease of implementation. The plan is structured into four categories: Quick Wins, Critical Priorities, Medium-term Improvements, and Long-term Security Enhancements.

Quick Wins focus on high-impact fixes with relatively low effort. These include disabling SMB signing and verifying open ports.

Critical Priorities require immediate attention due to their potential for exploitation or significant impact on system security. Restricting IPC shares and securing disk shares are top priorities.

Medium-term Improvements address notable weaknesses that, while not critical, still pose a risk. Verifying printer service configuration and monitoring ARP traffic fit into this category.

Long-term Security Enhancements aim to strengthen the system's overall security posture. This includes implementing secure FTP configurations and long-term security enhancements.
