## Executive Summary

**REASONING**

The Juice Shop website, a popular target for penetration testing, was subjected to a comprehensive security assessment to evaluate its current security posture. The test aimed to identify vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors. Given the nature of the test, it is essential to present the findings in a way that is both technical and accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

The critical risk identified during the penetration test is the potential for server crash, which poses an immediate threat to the business's operational integrity. This finding has significant implications for the Juice Shop's ability to maintain customer trust and confidence in their services. Additionally, while no high-severity vulnerabilities were discovered, six medium-severity issues were identified that warrant attention.

To mitigate these risks, we recommend that the Juice Shop implements a robust security patching schedule, conducts regular vulnerability assessments, and considers implementing additional security measures such as web application firewalls (WAFs) to protect against potential attacks.

**RESPONSE**

The Juice Shop's current security posture is vulnerable to significant threats, with the most critical risk being the potential for server crash. This finding highlights the importance of maintaining up-to-date software, securing sensitive data, and implementing robust security controls to prevent unauthorized access.

To address these risks, we recommend that the Juice Shop prioritizes the following actions:

1. Implement a comprehensive patch management schedule to ensure all software is updated regularly.
2. Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.
3. Consider implementing additional security measures such as WAFs to protect against web-based attacks.

By taking these steps, the Juice Shop can significantly reduce its exposure to cyber threats and maintain a secure environment for its customers and operations.
