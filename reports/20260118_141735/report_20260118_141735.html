        <p><strong>Target:</strong> https://juiceshop.ss.hackme</p>
        <p><strong>Session ID:</strong> 20260118_141735</p>
        <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2026-01-18 14:32:51</p>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <div><p><strong>REASONING<strong></p><p>The Juice Shop penetration test aimed to evaluate the security posture of a web application, assessing its vulnerability to various types of attacks. The test was conducted over a 12-minute period, during which three findings were identified. While none of these findings resulted in critical vulnerabilities, they highlight areas that require attention to prevent potential security breaches.</p><p>The most significant risk identified is related to the server leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header field. This could potentially allow an attacker to gather sensitive information about the application's configuration and identify vulnerabilities. Although this finding is not currently exploitable, it underscores the importance of maintaining up-to-date software versions and configuring headers correctly.</p><p>The test results demonstrate that while the Juice Shop web application has some security weaknesses, they are not critical at present. However, addressing these issues promptly will help prevent potential security breaches and protect the organization's assets.</p><p><strong>RESPONSE<strong></p><p>Based on the penetration test findings, we recommend that the Juice Shop web application takes immediate action to address the identified vulnerabilities. Specifically, we suggest:</p><p><em> Updating the server software to the latest version to prevent information leaks
<em> Configuring the "Server" HTTP response header field correctly to avoid revealing sensitive information
<em> Conducting regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses before they become critical</p><p>By taking these steps, the Juice Shop web application can significantly enhance its security posture and reduce the risk of a successful attack. We recommend that these actions be implemented as soon as possible to ensure the organization's assets are protected.</p></div>

    <h2>Technical Findings</h2>
    <div><p><strong>Technical Findings Section<strong></p><p>### 1. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)</p><p>#### Title and Severity
Cross-Domain Misconfiguration - LOW</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
https://juiceshop.ss.hackme</p><p>#### Technical Description
The web application is vulnerable to cross-domain misconfiguration due to an incorrectly set "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header. This header allows requests from any domain, potentially allowing attackers to access sensitive data.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <em></p><p>Proof of concept: Using the Zap tool, we can send a request with the `Origin` header set to an arbitrary domain, which would allow us to access sensitive data.</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
An attacker could exploit this misconfiguration to access sensitive data by sending a request with a maliciously crafted `Origin` header. However, due to the lack of any sensitive data in the provided target, the impact is considered low.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to only allow requests from specific domains.
2. Implement proper CORS configuration using the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a more restrictive set of domains.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector (if applicable)

OWASP: Unmapped
CWE-264</p><p>### 2. Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)</p><p>#### Title and Severity
Server Leaks Version Information - HIGH</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
https://juiceshop.ss.hackme</p><p>#### Technical Description
The web application leaks version information via the "Server" HTTP response header field, which could potentially be exploited by attackers to identify vulnerabilities in the server.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: nginx/1.29.4</p><p>Proof of concept: Using the Zap tool, we can inspect the "Server" header response from the target, revealing the version information of the web application server.</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by identifying other vulnerabilities in the web application server using the leaked version information. However, due to the lack of any sensitive data in the provided target, the impact is considered high.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Suppress or remove the "Server" header from HTTP responses.
2. Implement a more secure configuration for the web application server.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector (if applicable)

CWE-497</p><p>### 3. Re-examine Cache-control Directives (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)</p><p>#### Title and Severity
Re-examine Cache-control Directives - LOW</p><p>#### Affected Component/Service
https://juiceshop.ss.hackme</p><p>#### Technical Description
The web application lacks proper cache-control directives, which may lead to sensitive content being cached.</p><p>#### Evidence and Proof of Concept
Evidence: cache-control</p><p>Proof of concept: Using the Zap tool, we can inspect the HTTP headers response from the target, revealing the lack of proper cache-control directives.</p><p>#### Impact Analysis
The lack of proper cache-control directives may lead to sensitive content being cached, potentially compromising the security of the web application. However, due to the lack of any sensitive data in the provided target, the impact is considered low.</p><p>#### Remediation Steps
1. Set the "cache-control" HTTP header with proper directives.
2. Implement a more secure caching mechanism for the web application.</p><p>#### CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector (if applicable)
AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H</p><p>#### OWASP Top 10 (2021) and CWE Mapping

    <h2>Remediation Plan</h2>
    <div><p><strong>REASONING<strong></p><p>To create an actionable remediation plan, I considered the severity of each finding, potential impact on the system, and ease of implementation. The prioritization is based on a combination of these factors.</p><p>The three recommendations are:</p><p>1. <strong>Cross-Domain Misconfiguration<strong>: This finding has a low confidence level but high impact due to its potential for sensitive data exposure. However, it's relatively easy to fix by configuring the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header.
2. <strong>Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field<strong>: This finding has a medium confidence level and high impact due to its potential for identifying vulnerabilities in the web application server. It requires more effort to suppress or remove the "Server" header, but it's still a relatively straightforward fix.
3. <strong>Re-examine Cache-control Directives<strong>: This finding also has a low confidence level and moderate impact. However, it's an easy fix that can be implemented quickly.</p><p>Considering these factors, I prioritized the recommendations as follows:</p><p><em> Quick Wins (easy fixes with high impact): Re-examine Cache-control Directives
