# Penetration Test Report

## Target Information
- **Target**: 192.168.1.232
- **Session ID**: 20260122_202311
- **Date**: 2026-01-22 20:36:27
- **Duration**: 0h 13m
- **Subject Alternative Names (SAN)**: No additional SAN attributes listed

## Executive Summary

**REASONING**

The security posture of the target system, 192.168.1.232, is a critical concern for the organization. The penetration test revealed a range of vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited by malicious actors, compromising sensitive data and disrupting business operations. The most critical risks identified during the test are related to remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) and open TCP Port 3389. These findings highlight the need for immediate attention and remediation to prevent potential security breaches.

The presence of these high-risk vulnerabilities underscores the importance of prioritizing security measures to protect against sophisticated attacks. The test also revealed several medium-severity issues, including SMBv1 denial-of-service vulnerabilities, which, while less critical, still warrant attention to ensure the overall security posture is robust. The low-risk findings are largely administrative in nature and do not pose a significant threat to the organization's security.

**RESPONSE**

Based on the penetration test results, I strongly recommend that the organization takes immediate action to address the high-priority vulnerabilities identified during the test. Specifically, we recommend:

* Patching the remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) as soon as possible
* Closing open TCP Port 3389 to prevent unauthorized access
* Implementing measures to mitigate SMBv1 denial-of-service vulnerabilities

Additionally, I suggest that the organization conducts a thorough review of its security controls and procedures to ensure they are aligned with industry best practices. This will help to identify and address any additional vulnerabilities or weaknesses that may exist.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The penetration test has identified critical vulnerabilities in the target system, 192.168.1.232, which pose a significant risk to the organization's security. The most critical risks are related to remote code execution vulnerabilities in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) and open TCP Port 3389. We strongly recommend that these high-priority vulnerabilities be addressed immediately to prevent potential security breaches.

**REASONING**

To analyze the combined results from multiple tools, I will follow a structured approach:

1. **Pattern identification**: I will look for connections between different findings, such as open ports, vulnerabilities, and services.
2. **Attack chain visualization**: I will attempt to create a visual representation of potential attack paths using the identified patterns and correlations.
3. **Prioritization**: I will evaluate the vulnerabilities based on their exploitability, severity, and potential impact.
4. **Security posture assessment**: I will assess the overall security posture by considering the findings in context with known security best practices.
5. **Recommendations**: I will provide recommendations for next testing steps, focusing on addressing high-priority vulnerabilities first.

**RESPONSE**

Based on the combined results from MASSCAN and NMAP, here are my observations:

1. **Pattern identification**: The most notable pattern is the presence of open ports, particularly TCP Port 139 (NetBIOS), which is often used for SMBv1 communication.
2. **Attack chain visualization**:
	* A potential attack path could involve exploiting the open NetBIOS port (TCP Port 139) to gain access to the system.
	* From there, an attacker could attempt to exploit the Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) to execute arbitrary code on the system.
3. **Prioritization**:
	* High-priority vulnerabilities: Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) and Open TCP Port 3389 (RDP).
	* Medium-priority vulnerabilities: Open TCP Port 139 (NetBIOS), Open TCP Port 135, and Open TCP Port 445.
4. **Security posture assessment**: The presence of open ports and multiple instances of Remote Code Execution vulnerabilities suggests a potential security risk. However, the fact that some services are marked as LOW or INFO indicates that they may not be critical to address immediately.
5. **Recommendations**:

* Address the high-priority vulnerabilities: Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010) and Open TCP Port 3389 (RDP).
* Perform further analysis on the open NetBIOS port (TCP Port 139) to determine its potential impact.
* Consider implementing a patch for the SMBv1 protocol, as it is no longer supported by Microsoft.
* Schedule additional testing to verify the effectiveness of any implemented patches and to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.

**SEVERITY RATINGS**

* Remote Code Execution vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1 servers (ms17-010): CRITICAL
* Open TCP Port 3389: HIGH
* Open NetBIOS port (TCP Port 139): MEDIUM
* Open TCP Port 135: MEDIUM
* Open TCP Port 445: MEDIUM

**OWASP TOP 10 (2021) AND CWE MAPPING**
