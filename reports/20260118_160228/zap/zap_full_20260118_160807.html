        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> <code>public, max-age=0</code></p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content.

        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> For secure content, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate". If an asset should be cached consider setting the directives "public, max-age, immutable".</p>

        <p><strong>URL:</strong> https://juiceshop.ss.hackme</p>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.</p>

Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.</p>

        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.</p>
