# Penetration Test Report

## Target Information
- **Target**: https://juiceshop.ss.hackme
- **Session ID**: 20260118_160228
- **Date**: 2026-01-18 16:18:46
- **Duration**: 0h 16m

## Executive Summary

**REASONING**

The penetration test of Juiceshop SS was conducted to assess the security posture of the target system, identifying potential vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive data or disrupt business operations. The test revealed a range of weaknesses, with two critical issues standing out as high-risk threats. These findings indicate that the organization's reliance on self-signed certificates without proper chain of trust and lack of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) URI provision may leave it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and certificate validation failures.

Furthermore, the test highlighted a potential issue with the target system's configuration, which could allow for unauthorized access. These critical risks have significant implications for the organization's ability to protect sensitive data and maintain customer trust.

**RESPONSE**

Based on the findings of this penetration test, we strongly recommend that Juiceshop SS takes immediate action to address these high-risk vulnerabilities. Specifically, we advise implementing a trusted certificate authority (CA) to issue secure certificates with proper chain of trust, setting up an OCSP URI to validate certificates in real-time, and reviewing and updating system configurations to prevent unauthorized access.

Additionally, we suggest conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. By taking proactive steps to strengthen its security posture, Juiceshop SS can minimize the risk of data breaches and maintain a competitive edge in the market.
